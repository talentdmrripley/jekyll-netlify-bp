Creating content is hard some times, or creating _creative_ content can feel burdensome. However, I think the real test of a website--static or dynamic--is the day to day managment of content, or _workflow_.

Much like cooking, we enjoy the food and hope others do as well. Great content should offer visitors an experience. However, what we don't see is the work that went into building the experience, or managing all the experiences. 

While exploring different types of static site generators, I'm also attempting to gain a sense of workflow. 

	1. How easy is it to create new content?
	2. How much effort goes into edits?
	3. How _brittle_ is the framework as content and code collide?
	4. Which touchpoints do I need to be mindful of along the way?

### 1. Creating new content
===============

So far, the static generators offer a straight forward path for creating new content. [Nanoc](https://www.nanoc.ws) offers post creation through the command line. In [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com], which powers this site) (currently), looks for new posts in the _posts folder, #.md files, prepended with a hard date such as 2019-09-30-title-of-post.md
