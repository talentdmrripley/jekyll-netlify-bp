As promised in the [about](https://half-lifed.com/about) section, this website is also about personal growth. 

At this age, it's fair to say I know some things. But, it's more accurate to admit I don't know shit. So let's just start with a big old list of truths, half-truths, and lies about life. Whatever sense can be drawn from this list is my gift to the reader.


1. Day by day, my interpretations of life are either accurate or absurd.
2. Life is to be lived, not some answer on a test.
3. You never figure out life; life figures you out.
4. Life is 99 percent how we respond to life.
5. Fixing yourself is much harder than wrecking others.
6. Name three things you stood for yesterday that you stand for today?
7. Success teaches us less about ourselves than the struggle.
8. Master these three:
	- "Please"
	- "Thank you"
	- "I'm sorry"
9. something else here
